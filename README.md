# pack2-example

These 2 files show an example of how to open and export models from Planetside 2 .pack2 files in python3. They assume you are using Linux on Windows, if you aren't just change the test_server path to a normal Windows path ("C:/Users..." vs "/mnt/c/Users...")

These require numpy, numpy-stl, [DbgPack](https://github.com/brhumphe/dbg-pack), glob, and some standard python libraries to work. These are meant as an example for anyone looking to extract models from the game, more (outdated but still useful) technical information can be found here: https://github.com/psemu
